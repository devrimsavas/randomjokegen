hi. In this script , i wrote a dynamic webpage e to fetch a random joke each time the button is clicked. The technic i used: asynchronous programming (async), API integration, and a touch of animation.As you remember we have already  seen  , Asynchronous Programming. The async function in the script section indicates that the function operates asynchronously. This means that the function allows the webpage to perform other tasks while it awaits the completion of the API call, enhancing performance and user experience.the API used here:(https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke) is called to fetch a random joke each time the button is clicked.
The fetched data is then processed and displayed in the text area in the format: setup line, punchline, and accompanied by randomized emojis.
In this small script , we used json to retrieve data. I hope it will be useful.
